# j — specification

`j` is a command-line interface to Jujutsu (jj) repositories. It is an
interpreter for a small, pure, dynamically typed functional language. A
repository is a value in that language; every command is an expression that
maps the current repository value to a new one, or to something to print.

Nothing is implicit beyond the language itself. Every shape, builtin, and
command is declared or defined in one user-owned file, `~/.config/j/config.j`,
written in the language. The binary provides the language (its syntax, its
operators and their fixities, its primitive kinds), the implementations of the
declared builtins, eight reserved words, and the bridge to jj repositories.
`j` does not require the `jj` binary; it uses jj's on-disk formats through
jj-lib.

This document is the complete specification for implementing `j`. Section 9 is
the reference `config.j`; it is part of the specification and ships with the
binary.

---

## 1. Invocation

```
j EXPRESSION…
echo EXPRESSION | j
```

`j` takes the expression from its arguments or from standard input.

1. If standard input is not a terminal and contains at least one byte, the
   expression is the entire content of standard input.
2. Otherwise the expression is the arguments joined with single spaces,
   verbatim. Nothing is quoted or wrapped on the user's behalf: a `Text` is
   a text only if it is quoted in the language, so a message is written
   `j 'describe "fix login"'` (or `j describe '"fix"'`), while `j new` is
   `new` and `j tree . squash` is `tree . squash`. Shell quoting is needed
   only for characters the shell owns: double quotes, parentheses, brackets,
   braces, a backslash, `<` `>` `|` `&` `;` `*` `$`. The operators `++`,
   `::`, `or`, `.`, and the literals `%name`, `@id`, `./a/b` are all safe
   unquoted.
3. If arguments are present and rule 1 also applies, exit 2 with
   `j: expression given both as arguments and on stdin`.
4. If neither is present, print a one-line usage message to stderr and exit 2.
5. `j` accepts no flags. Any argument, including ones beginning with `-`, is
   part of the expression.

### 1.1 Reserved commands

Before the expression is parsed, its text is trimmed of leading and trailing
whitespace and split on whitespace into words. If the first word is one of the
eight reserved words below, the whole text is a reserved command.

| command | operation |
|---|---|
| `init` | create a repository in the current directory; §7.8 |
| `clone URL [DIR]` | clone `URL` into `DIR` (default: last path component of `URL`, minus `.git`); §7.8 |
| `remote URL` | set the URL of the remote `origin`, creating it if absent; §7.8 |
| `fetch` | fetch from `origin`; §7.6 |
| `push EXPR` | set or delete the remote bookmarks that `EXPR` selects; §7.6 |
| `undo` | restore the repository as it was before the newest operation; §7.7 |
| `redo` | reverse the newest undo; §7.7 |
| `ops` | print the operation log; §7.7 |

For every reserved command except `push`, the remaining words are literal
arguments (no quoting, no escaping); a wrong number is a usage error (exit 2)
and the language is not involved. For `push`, the remainder of the text is an
expression, evaluated as in §1.2 steps 2–7 but against the repository as
recorded, without snapshotting the working directory; its value must be a list
of push records (§7.6).

Matching is on the first word only, so an expression whose first token is one
of these words cannot be written on the command line. `(push)` or `x fetch`
are ordinary expressions. `config.j` may define functions with these names;
they are reachable only inside larger expressions.

### 1.2 Evaluating the expression

1. Locate the repository (§7.1). If none, exit 2.
2. Parse the expression (§3). On parse error, exit 3.
3. Load and validate `config.j` (§6), except for its `Id` literals. If it is
   missing or invalid, exit 3.
4. Build the current repository value `r` (§7.2). This includes snapshotting
   the working directory into the focused commit (§7.4).
5. Resolve every `Id` literal in `config.j` and in the expression (§4.10).
   A failure in `config.j` is a configuration error (exit 3); one in the
   expression is a crash (exit 1). Nothing has been evaluated.
6. Evaluate `config.j`'s definitions (§4.1), then the expression, to a value
   `v`.
7. If `v` is a function, apply it to `r`, once, and let `v` be the result.
8. If `v` is a `Repo` (§4.4): if it equals the repository value *as loaded,
   before the snapshot of §7.4*, do nothing at all; otherwise persist it
   (§7.5) and check out its focused commit's files (§7.4). Print nothing.
   Exit 0.
9. Otherwise display `v` (§5.1) on stdout. Persist nothing. Exit 0.

If evaluation crashes (§4.7) at any point, print the crash message to stderr,
persist nothing, leave the working directory untouched, and exit 1.

Step 7 applies exactly once. If the result of applying a function to `r` is
again a function, that function is displayed, not applied again.

Step 8's equality test means `j id` is a no-op when the working directory is
unchanged and records it when it is not: the snapshot makes `r` differ from
the loaded value, and that difference is what gets persisted. The test may be
implemented by comparing commit and tree hashes rather than values.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **Dry run.** A `Text` result is displayed and persists nothing, and `.`
  composes a renderer after an edit, so `j tree . rebase trunk` shows
  what a rebase would produce without doing it. `validate` in the chain,
  `j tree . validate . rebase trunk`, additionally raises whatever
  persistence would refuse, so the preview is of something that could
  actually be persisted.
- **Do, then look.** `j squash` prints nothing. `j squash && j tree` is the
  idiom; there is no flag for it.

### 1.3 Interrupts

There is no timeout. A non-terminating expression runs until interrupted.
Interrupting `j` (SIGINT) kills it; because nothing is written until
evaluation completes, an interrupted run persists nothing and leaves the
working directory untouched.

### 1.4 Exit status

| status | meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | success |
| 1 | the expression crashed, or a reserved command was refused |
| 2 | usage error: bad arguments, no repository, unsupported repository (§7.2), another `j` running (§7.7) |
| 3 | configuration or parse error |

Errors are written to stderr as a single line beginning with `j: `. Crash
messages are the text given to `crash` (or generated by the interpreter),
prefixed with `j: crash: `, followed on a second line by the innermost base
definition that was executing and the top-level expression.

---

## 2. Values

The language has these kinds of values. The primitive kinds are part of the
language and are not declared anywhere.

| kind | notes |
|---|---|
| `Int` | arbitrary-precision integer |
| `Text` | Unicode string |
| `Bool` | `true` or `false` |
| list | finite, ordered, homogeneous by convention, `[a b c]` |
| record | unordered set of named fields, `{ a = 1, b = "x" }` |
| function | closure, builtin, or partial application |
| `Id` | opaque: a jj change id. Literal `@kpqx` for an existing one (a unique prefix is enough); bare `@` for a new one (§4.10) |
| `Blob` | opaque: the content of one file, resolved or unresolved |
| `Shape` | a type name used as a value (§4.12) |

Records are structural. A record is not declared; it is whatever fields it
has. The shapes in `config.j` name field sets, and a record *is* a `Commit`,
say, exactly when its field set is `Commit`'s (§4.12). Two records are the
same value if they have the same field names with equal values.

---

## 3. Syntax

### 3.1 Lexical structure

- **Comments.** `--` to end of line. `{-` … `-}`, nesting.
- **Identifiers.** `[a-z_][A-Za-z0-9_']*`. Keywords are excluded:
  `let in if then else or true false`.
- **Type names.** `[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_]*`. Declared as shapes in `config.j`;
  usable in expressions as values (§4.12).
- **Integer literals.** `[0-9]+`. There is no unary minus; write `0 - 1`.
- **Text literals.** `"…"` with escapes `\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\t`, `\r`.
- **Id literals.** `@` immediately followed by one or more of the letters
  `k`–`z` (jj's change-id alphabet), e.g. `@wqzt`: an existing id, given in
  full or by a unique prefix.
- **New id.** `@` followed by anything other than an identifier character
  is the token `NEWID`. `@` followed by an identifier character outside
  `k`–`z` (`@main`) is a lexical error.
- **Label literals.** `%` immediately followed by a git branch name
  (`[A-Za-z0-9._/-]+`, not starting with `.` or `-`, not containing `..`,
  not ending in `/` or `.lock`), e.g. `%main`.
- **Path literals.** `./` at the start of a token, extending to the next
  whitespace or one of `( ) [ ] { } , ;`: `./src/lexer.rs`. This rule runs
  before the selector and operator rules for `.`, so a `.` inside a path is
  part of the path. The literal denotes the list of components after the
  `./`; a trailing `/` is ignored and a bare `./` is `[]`, the root. Names
  the literal cannot spell are built with `splitOn "/"`.
- **Operators.** Exactly these tokens, and no others (§3.2):
  `.  *  +  -  ++  ::  ==  /=  <  <=  >  >=  &&  ||`, plus the keyword
  `or`, which is an operator syntactically.
- **Selector.** A `.` immediately followed (no whitespace) by an identifier is a
  single selector token `.name`. Any other `.` is the operator `.`.
- **Punctuation.** `( ) [ ] { } , ; : \ = -> _`. The colon `:` is punctuation:
  it separates a name from its type in declarations and record types, and
  appears nowhere else.

### 3.2 Operators and fixities

The operator set and its fixities are part of the language. No others exist
and none can be declared.

```
infixr 9  .
infixl 7  *
infixl 6  +  -
infixr 5  ++  ::
infix  4  ==  /=  <  <=  >  >=
infixr 3  &&
infixr 2  ||
infixl 0  or
```

Non-associative (`infix`) operators cannot be chained. Each symbolic operator
is still a builtin that must be declared in `config.j` to be usable (§6.2);
the table fixes how they parse, not whether they are in scope. `or` is a
keyword and is always available.

### 3.3 Layout

Two layout rules and nothing else.

1. **Top level.** A top-level item begins with a token in column 1. Every
   following line whose first token is in a column greater than 1 continues
   the item. Blank and comment-only lines are ignored.
2. **`let` blocks.** After `let`, the column of the first token opens a block.
   A subsequent line whose first token is in exactly that column begins a new
   binding; a line indented further continues the current binding; the block
   ends at `in` or at the first token in a smaller column. Bindings on a single
   line are separated by `;`. Blank and comment-only lines are ignored here
   too.

An expression given on the command line or on stdin is a single `expr`, not a
list of items, so rule 1 does not apply to it; rule 2 does.

### 3.4 Grammar

```
config     := item*
item       := typedecl | signature | definition

typedecl   := TYPENAME '=' type
signature  := (ident | '(' op ')') ':' type
definition := ident '=' expr

type       := atype ('->' type)?
atype      := TYPENAME | ident | '[' type ']' | '{' (ident ':' type (',' ident ':' type)*)? '}' | '(' type ')'

pattern    := ident | '_'

expr       := '\' pattern+ '->' expr
            | 'if' expr 'then' expr 'else' expr
            | 'let' bindings 'in' expr
            | opexpr
bindings   := binding ((NEWLINE|';') binding)*
binding    := ident '=' expr

opexpr     := app (op app)*             -- resolved by the fixity table
app        := postfix+                  -- juxtaposition; left-associative
postfix    := atom ( SELECTOR | '{' fields '}' )*
atom       := ident | TYPENAME | INT | TEXT | IDLIT | NEWID | LABELLIT | PATHLIT | 'true' | 'false'
            | '(' expr ')' | '(' op ')' | '(' op expr ')' | '(' expr op ')'
            | '[' postfix* ']'
            | '{' fields '}'
            | SELECTOR
fields     := (ident '=' expr (',' ident '=' expr)*)?
```

Notes:

- A definition binds a name to a value. Functions are values made with `\`;
  there is no separate function-definition syntax. `\x y -> e` takes two
  parameters.
- A signature immediately preceding a definition of the same name (blank
  lines and comments between are fine) documents and checks that definition
  (§4.13). A signature with no definition declares a builtin. At most one
  signature per name.
- `(op e)` is a right section (`\x -> x op e`), `(e op)` a left section
  (`\x -> e op x`), `(op)` the operator as a function.
- A bare `SELECTOR` atom `.name` is the accessor function `\x -> x.name`.
- `postfix` binds tighter than application, as in Haskell: `f r { a = 1 }`
  is `f (r { a = 1 })`. Consequently a record *literal* passed as an argument
  after another atom must be parenthesised: `attach ({ root = c, children = [] }) r`.
- List elements are separated by whitespace, not commas, and each element is
  a `postfix` (an atom with selectors and updates): `[1 2 3]`,
  `["src" "lexer.rs"]`, `[{ root = c, children = [] }]`. An application or
  operator expression as an element is parenthesised: `[(up repo).root.id]`.
  Records keep commas.
- Lambda, `if`, `let`, and `or` extend as far right as possible.
- Patterns are variables and `_` only. No literal, list, or record patterns.

---

## 4. Semantics

### 4.1 Evaluation

Strict, call by value, left to right. Function application is curried. All
top-level definitions in `config.j` and all bindings of one `let` block are
mutually recursive. A top-level definition is evaluated once, at load, in
dependency order: a definition is evaluated after every definition its body
refers to outside a lambda. A cycle among such references (two non-lambda
definitions each needing the other's value) is a configuration error;
references inside lambda bodies never form cycles, since a lambda is a value
before it is applied. The bindings of a `let` block are evaluated by the same
rule, with a cycle being a crash. A lambda body is evaluated on each
application.
Recursion is unbounded; the interpreter must handle deep recursion without
stack overflow (or turn exhaustion into a crash).

### 4.2 Scoping

Names resolve lexically: `let` bindings, then lambda parameters, then
top-level definitions and declared builtins. Field names are not in any
namespace; they occur only after `.`, in record literals, and in record
updates, so a field may be called `id` while `id` remains the identity
function.

There is no shadowing. A `let` binding or lambda parameter may not use a name
already bound in an enclosing scope, including top-level definitions and
declared builtins; in `config.j` that is a configuration error (exit 3), on
the command line a parse error. Defining a top-level name twice, or defining a
name that is also a declared builtin, is a configuration error.

### 4.3 Records

- `e.f` selects field `f`; crashes if absent.
- `e { f = v, … }` returns a copy with the listed fields replaced; crashes if
  any listed field is absent. Update never adds fields.
- Duplicate field names in a literal or update are a parse error.

### 4.4 Which values are a `Repo`

A value is treated as a `Repo` in §1.2 step 8 if and only if its shape is
`Repo` and its `root`'s shape is `Commit`, in the sense of §4.12 (exact field
sets). Deeper shape errors surface as crashes during persistence.

### 4.5 Equality

`==` is structural on ints, texts, bools, lists, and records; identity on
`Id`; content-and-mode on `Blob`; on shapes, equal field sets or the same
primitive kind. Comparing functions crashes. `/=` is its
negation. Ordering operators are defined on `Int` only and crash otherwise.

### 4.6 Special forms

`if`, `or`, `&&`, and `||` do not evaluate all operands. `&&` and `||`
short-circuit. The interpreter recognises `&&` and `||` by name; `or` is a
keyword.

`a or b` evaluates `a`. If that crashes, the crash is discarded and `b` is
evaluated and returned. Otherwise, if the value of `a` is a function, `b` is
evaluated too, and if it is also a function the result is the function
`\x -> a x or b x`, with the same rule applying again to its result. In every
other case the result is the value of `a` and `b` is not evaluated. The
lifting is what makes `edit or id` mean "try the edit, keep the repository if
it crashes": a function value cannot crash until it is applied, so without
lifting the `or` would catch nothing.

### 4.7 Crashes

`crash msg` aborts evaluation with `msg`. Every runtime error the interpreter
detects (unbound name, wrong kind of value, missing field, out-of-range index,
`head []`, `concat []`, comparing functions, non-`Bool` condition, arity or
kind errors in builtins) is a crash with an interpreter-generated message, and
is catchable by `or` exactly like a user crash. Nothing else is catchable: parse
and configuration errors, and `Id` literal resolution, happen before
evaluation.

### 4.8 Overloading

Two builtins dispatch on the kind of an argument; functions compose with `.`:

| builtin | list | Text | function |
|---|---|---|---|
| `++` | concatenation | concatenation | crash |
| `concat` | flatten `[[a]] -> [a]` | join `[Text] -> Text` | crash |

`concat []` crashes (there is nothing to dispatch on). `map`, `filter`,
`length`, `null`, `head`, `tail`, `nth`, `take`, `drop`, `last`, `member`,
`foldl`, and `::` are defined on lists only.

### 4.9 Builtins

The following table is normative for behaviour. Each builtin is available only
if `config.j` declares it (§6.2); the declared type is enforced at each call
as in §4.13.

| name | behaviour |
|---|---|
| `.` | composition: `(f . g) x = f (g x)` |
| `id` | identity |
| `const` | `const a b = a` |
| `crash` | §4.7 |
| `==`, `/=` | §4.5 |
| `&&`, `||`, `not` | booleans; `&&`/`||` short-circuit |
| `+`, `-`, `*` | integer arithmetic |
| `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` | integer comparison |
| `show` | renders any value as text in literal syntax (§5.2) |
| `::` | cons |
| `map`, `filter` | as usual |
| `length`, `null` | as usual |
| `head`, `tail`, `last` | crash on empty |
| `nth i xs` | 0-based; crash out of range |
| `take n`, `drop n` | clamp to list length |
| `member x xs` | membership by `==` |
| `range a b` | `[a (a+1) … (b-1)]`, empty if `b <= a` |
| `foldl f z xs` | left fold: `foldl f z [x y] = f (f z x) y`; `z` for `[]` |
| `concat`, `++` | §4.8 |
| `startsWith p t`, `endsWith s t` | text predicates |
| `splitOn sep t` | the pieces of `t` between occurrences of `sep`; `splitOn "/" "a/b"` is `["a" "b"]`, `splitOn "/" ""` is `[""]` |
| `replay onto ch` | replay the change `ch` (`{ from, to }`) onto the snapshot `onto`; §7.3 |
| `unresolved b` | `true` iff the blob is a conflict |
| `blob t` | a resolved regular-file blob with content `t` |
| `text b` | the content of a blob as text; for an unresolved blob, its conflict-marker rendering |
| `by i repo` | the repo refocused on the commit with id `i`; crashes if absent. Backed by the change-id index; its reference definition is in §10 |
| `diff a b` | a unified diff from the text of `a` to the text of `b`, no header lines, three lines of context; `""` if equal; crashes if either is not UTF-8 |
| `difft p a b` | the output of difftastic comparing `a` to `b` as the file `p`; §7.10. Crashes if `difft` is not on `PATH` |
| `treeWith o r` | the history rendered as a tree with options record `o`; §7.11 |
| `extract S v` | every subvalue of `v` that is an `S`; §4.12 |
| `meta i` | `{ hash, author, email, time }` for the visible commit with change id `i`: its current git hash, author name and email, committer time. Crashes for an id with no stored commit (one minted in this program) |
| `validate repo` | `repo` unchanged if persisting it would succeed; otherwise the crash persistence would raise (§7.5 steps 1–3 and 6). Persistence runs the same checks |

### 4.10 Ids: existing and new

**Existing.** An `Id` literal `@kpqx` denotes the existing commit whose id
begins with `kpqx`. It is resolved before evaluation, not during it:

- In the command-line expression, every literal is resolved after parsing and
  before evaluation (§1.2 step 5), against the ids visible when the program
  started. A literal that matches no id or more than one is a crash that lists
  the candidates in commit-table form (§5.1); nothing is evaluated.
- In `config.j`, every literal is resolved at load, against the same ids. A
  literal that fails to resolve is a configuration error (exit 3) naming the
  definition it appears in.

After resolution a literal is an ordinary `Id` value holding the full id, so
`==` on ids is identity and never involves prefixes.

**New.** The bare token `@` is an expression that yields a distinct, freshly
minted `Id` each time it is evaluated. In a script that writes `@` once, this
is indistinguishable from replacing it with a new id before the run. In a
lambda body it is evaluated on each application, so `newCommit` (§9) mints a new
id per call. A top-level definition that is a bare record containing `@` is
evaluated once at load and holds one id for the whole program (§4.1). `show`
renders a minted id like any other.

### 4.11 Label literals

`%main` denotes `labelled "main"`, a `Revset`. It is a function, evaluated
when applied, so it never fails at parse time: a name the remote does not have
yields `[]`, and `goto %nope` crashes with "expected one revision, got 0" as
any revset would.

### 4.12 Shapes as values, and `extract`

A type name used in an expression evaluates to a *shape*: for a `typedecl`
whose type is a record, the set of its field names; for a primitive kind
(`Int`, `Text`, `Bool`, `Id`, `Blob`), that kind; for a `typedecl` that is an
alias of another type, that type's shape. A shape whose type is a function
(`Edit`, `Revset`), a list, or undeclared is a crash when used.

`extract S v` returns every subvalue of `v` that is an `S`, as a list. It
walks lists in order and records in ascending field-name order, descending
into every element and field; it does not enter functions or blobs. A record
is an `S` if its field set is exactly `S`'s (the same rule display uses to
recognise shapes); a primitive value is an `S` if it is of that kind. Matches
are collected in traversal order, and a matching record is also searched
inside for nested matches.

```haskell
extract Commit repo       -- every commit reachable from a Repo, Subtree, or Frame
extract Id repo           -- every id in it
extract Push xs           -- the Push records in a list, however nested
```

`extract` does not promise a meaningful order for values with several
positional fields; a `Repo` yields its `children` before its `context` before
its `root`. Where order matters, `commits (top repo)` is preorder.

### 4.13 Contracts

Every application of a function that has a signature — a builtin or a
definition with a signature — is checked against it: each argument as it is
supplied, against the corresponding parameter type, and the result once the
application is complete (yields a non-function), against the result type.
Lambdas without a signature and the command-line expression are unchecked
except through the functions they call. A signature on a definition that is
not a function (`user`, `conflicts`) is checked once, against the value, when
the definition is evaluated at load.

The check is one level deep and never inspects inside a list or a record's
field values:

| declared type | check |
|---|---|
| `Int`, `Text`, `Bool`, `Id`, `Blob`, `Shape` | the value is of that kind |
| `[T]` | the value is a list; elements are not inspected |
| `{ a : T, … }`, or a shape name | the value is a record with exactly those field names |
| `A -> B` | the value is a function |
| a type variable | anything |
| an alias (`Edit`, `Revset`, `Snapshot`) | the type it stands for; an alias of a function type is unfolded so that further arguments and the final result are checked against it (`at : Revset -> Edit -> Edit` checks three arguments and a `Repo` result) |

Field values and list elements are not checked because that would make every
call cost the size of the value and would force lazily backed snapshots and
histories (§7.2).

A violation is a crash, catchable by `or` like any other:

```
j: crash: contract: describe expected Text as argument 1, got Int
   in describe, from describe 3
```

For records the expected and actual field sets are shown:
`expected { files, labels, id, message }, got { children, context, root }`.

## 5. Output

Two renderers. **Display** is what the CLI prints; it is designed to be read.
**`show`** is the builtin; it renders literal syntax designed to be pasted
back. They share glyphs and colours with `treeWith` (§7.11) and are
implemented beside it.

### 5.1 Display

Every kind of value has a *line* form and a *block* form. The top-level value
prints in block form. Values nested inside another print in line form,
indented under their key or bullet. Colour follows §7.11's rules and is used
only when stdout is a terminal; nothing is conveyed by colour alone.

Shapes are recognised by their exact field set, as in §4.12: `Commit`, `Entry`,
`Subtree`, `Repo`, `Frame`, `Change`. Any other record is generic.

| kind | line form | block form |
|---|---|---|
| `Int` | decimal | same |
| `Bool` | `true` / `false` | same |
| `Text` | raw, first line, `…` if truncated | raw, all of it, trailing newline added if absent |
| `Id` | shortest unique prefix (bold), remainder (dim) | same |
| `Blob` | `‹214 B›`, `‹✖ 3.1 KB›` if unresolved | its content, raw (markers if unresolved) |
| function | name, lambda source, or `f arg …` | same |
| `Shape` | its type name | same |
| `Commit` | `glyph id  message  labels` — a `tree` line without rails | that line, then `author · age · n files`, then one changed path per line with `+ ~ − ✖` marks |
| `Entry` | `path  size`, `✖` prefix if unresolved | same |
| `Subtree` | its top commit's line form | a tree rooted at it, no focus |
| `Repo` | its focus's line form | `treeWith` with the config's `tree` options |
| `Frame` | its parent's line form | parent's line, then its children's line forms in a row with `▢` at the hole |
| `Change` | `n paths` | one touched path per line with `+ ~ − ✖` marks, as in a `Commit` block |
| generic record | `{ a, b, … }` (field names only) | one field per line, names left-aligned and dim, values indented if multi-line |
| list of `Id` | `n commits` | a commit table: one commit line per id, in list order |
| list of generic records with identical field sets | `n rows` | a column table with a dim header; `true` shows as `✓`, `false` as blank; columns empty in every row are dropped |
| list of `[Text]` | `n paths` | one per line, joined with `/` |
| list of `Text` | `n items` | one per line |
| list of other scalars | `a, b, c` | same, wrapped at the terminal width |
| any other list | `n items` | one block per item, separated by a blank line |

An empty list of any kind prints `none` (dim) in block form and `0 …` in
line form. Author and age in a `Commit` block are read from jj's commit
metadata by id;
they are not fields of the value. A list of `[Text]` prints as paths because
that is what such a list is in every base function; `show` is available
when the literal is wanted. Alignment in tables and columns uses display
width (East Asian wide characters count two cells, combining marks zero), not
code-point count.

```

### 5.2 `show`

`show v` renders `v` as an expression in the language, such that for every
value except closures and unresolved blobs, `show v` parses and evaluates to a
value equal to `v` under the same `config.j`. It never uses colour and never
truncates.

| kind | rendering |
|---|---|
| `Int` | decimal |
| `Text` | double-quoted, escaped as in §3.1 |
| `Bool` | `true` / `false` |
| list | `[v1 v2 …]` |
| record | `{ a = v, b = w }`, fields in ascending lexicographic order |
| `Id` | `@` followed by the full id, e.g. `@wqztkpqxmnrvyxskptlmzzzzabcd` |
| resolved `Blob` | `blob "…"` |
| unresolved `Blob` | `{- unresolved -} blob "…"` with the conflict-marker rendering |
| builtin | its declared name, operators parenthesised: `map`, `(++)` |
| top-level definition | its name |
| revset from a label literal | `%name` |
| shape | its type name: `Commit`, `Id` |
| lambda closure | its source text, exactly as written |
| partial application | the function's rendering followed by the arguments' renderings, each parenthesised if not atomic: `describe "wip"`, `at (parents) (describe "x")` |

Line breaking: one line if it fits in 80 columns; otherwise the outermost
list or record breaks one element per line, two-space indented, with leading
commas for records and nothing between list elements, recursively.

Since `show` returns a `Text` and a top-level `Text` displays raw,
`j show . focus` prints the literal of the focused commit, and
`show . f` does the same for any `f`.

## 6. Configuration

### 6.1 Location and loading

`j` reads `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/j/config.j`, defaulting to `~/.config/j/config.j`.
It is read by every invocation except `remote`, `fetch`, `undo`, `redo`, and
`ops`: expression evaluation and `push` need its definitions, `init` and
`clone` need `user`. When there is no repository yet (`init`, `clone`), only
`user` is evaluated; `Id` literals are not resolved and no other definition
is evaluated. If it does not exist, `j` exits 3 with
`j: no config at <path>; the reference config.j is installed at <share-path>`.
The binary is distributed with the reference `config.j` (§9) at
`<prefix>/share/j/config.j`; `j` never writes to the config path itself.

### 6.2 Validation

Loading fails (exit 3) if any of these hold:

1. The file does not parse (§3).
2. A signature without a definition names something the interpreter does not
   implement; or a name has two signatures; or a signature is not immediately
   followed by its definition when one exists.
3. A name is defined twice, or a definition uses the name of a builtin the
   interpreter implements (those names are reserved whether or not declared).
4. A `typedecl` name is declared twice.
5. An `Id` literal fails to resolve (§4.10).
6. `user`, `immutable`, `tree`, or `labelled` is absent; or `user` is not a
   record with non-empty `name` and `email` texts; or `immutable`, `tree`, or
   `labelled` is not a function.

Loading does **not** check types statically. Signatures are enforced at
each call, one level deep (§4.13). The *presence* of a signature with no
definition is what brings a builtin into scope; an implemented builtin that is
not declared is simply unbound, and using it is a runtime crash.

Definitions may reference each other in any order.

### 6.3 Definitions the interpreter reads

Four names in `config.j` are read by the interpreter itself, not only by
expressions:

- `user`, a record `{ name, email }`: the identity that authors commits
  (§7.9).
- `immutable`, a `Revset` that persistence evaluates to decide what may not be
  rewritten (§7.5).
- `tree`, used by display to render a `Repo` (§5.1).
- `labelled`, which a label literal `%name` desugars to (§4.11).

All four are ordinary definitions; the reference `config.j` provides them and
a user edits or redefines them.

---

## 7. Repositories

`j` operates on jj repositories through jj-lib. It creates jj commits,
operations, and working-copy state that `jj` itself can read, and vice versa,
but nothing here requires the `jj` binary to be installed.

### 7.1 Locating the repository

Walk up from the current directory to the first directory containing `.jj`.
Only the default workspace is supported; if the working directory belongs to
another workspace, exit 2.

### 7.2 Building the `Repo` value

The history of the repository is loaded at the current operation and mapped to
a value as follows.

- **Commits.** Every visible commit (an ancestor of a visible head), including
  jj's root commit, becomes a `Commit` record: `files` from its tree (§7.3),
  `message` from its description, `labels` from the remote bookmarks of
  `origin` pointing at it (§7.6), `id` from its change id.
- **Tree.** The root commit is the top of the tree. Each commit's parent is
  its **first** jj parent. A commit with two or more parents (a merge) is
  therefore placed under its first parent and its other parents are not
  represented; such a commit is *read-only* (§7.5). If two visible commits
  share a change id, exit 2 with
  `j: change <id> has two visible commits; j cannot operate on this repository`.
- **Child order.** A commit's children are ordered by committer timestamp
  ascending, ties broken by change-id text ascending. Within a program,
  `attach` appends. The order is presentation only: no command and no law
  depends on which child is first, and the language has no way to select a
  child by position.
- **Focus.** The zipper is focused on the default workspace's working-copy
  commit, after snapshotting (§7.4). `context` is computed from the path to the
  root. If that commit is in the immutable set (§7.5) — typically because a
  `fetch` found the remote's `main` pointing at it — the snapshot cannot go
  into it; the focus is instead a new empty child of it holding the snapshot,
  as `abandon` would leave it, and persisting records that child. Nothing
  else is written by loading.

The record is the *semantics*. An implementation may back `files`, `children`,
and `context` with lazily materialised structures, provided every observation
an expression can make agrees with the eager value.

### 7.3 Files, blobs, and `replay`

- A commit's `files` has one `Entry` per tracked path in its tree. `path` is
  the list of path components; components must be valid UTF-8, and a
  repository with a path that is not exits 2. `content` is a `Blob` carrying the file's
  content and type (regular, executable, symlink) and, for conflicted paths,
  jj's conflict value for that path.
- A path that is deleted and resolved has no entry. A path that is in a
  deletion conflict has an entry whose blob is unresolved.
- `replay onto { from, to }` is jj's tree merge: for each path present in
  any of the three snapshots, the three-way merge of that path's values with
  `from` as the common ancestor, replaying the change from `from` to `to` on
  top of `onto`. Conflicts are kept as unresolved blobs, and resolved where
  jj's merge would resolve them (identical changes, changes from the current
  content, non-overlapping line-level hunks). It never crashes on content. It
  crashes if any of the three is not a well-formed snapshot (a list of `Entry`
  records with unique paths).
- `unresolved`, `blob`, and `text` are as in §4.9. `blob` produces a regular
  file. File type (executable, symlink) travels with a `Blob` but cannot be
  changed in the language. `text` of a symlink is its target; `text` of a
  non-UTF-8 blob crashes.

### 7.4 Working-directory invariant

At every program boundary the files of the focused commit equal the working
directory.

- **Before evaluation**, the working directory is snapshotted into the
  working-copy commit, and that is the `files` of the focus in the `Repo`
  value. The snapshot tracks every file not matched by `.gitignore` files,
  with no size limit, symlinks as symlinks; these rules are fixed, since `j`
  reads no jj configuration. If the snapshot changed the commit, that change
  is part of the operation persisted afterwards, or discarded with the rest if
  nothing is persisted. A crashed or printing program leaves the working copy
  and the repository exactly as before; `j id` is the way to record the
  working directory and nothing else (§1.2).
- **After persistence**, the focus of the result is checked out: its files are
  written to the working directory, unresolved blobs materialised with jj's
  conflict markers, and the workspace's working-copy commit set to the focus.

Reserved commands never snapshot.

### 7.5 Persistence

Given the loaded value `old` and the result `new`, one jj operation is
recorded, described by the expression text (truncated to 200 characters).
Within it:

1. **Validate shape.** `new` has the shape of a `Repo`; every `id` occurs
   exactly once; every snapshot has unique paths. Violations crash with a
   message naming the rule.
2. **Validate labels.** The set of `(id, label)` pairs in `new` equals the set
   in `old`. Labels are the remote's names (§7.6); a script cannot add, move,
   or remove one. In particular a commit carrying a label cannot be abandoned.
3. **Validate immutability.** The *immutable set* is the config's `immutable`
   revset evaluated against `old`, together with every merge commit (§7.2)
   and all of its ancestors. Every id in it must be present in `new` with the
   same parent id, files, and message. Violations crash naming the commit.
   (Ancestors of merges are included because rewriting an ancestor rewrites
   the merge, whose second parent the model cannot represent.)
4. **Walk `new` top-down.** For each commit `c` (root first):
   - If `c.id` is the root commit's change id, it must be the top of the tree
     and must be unchanged; otherwise crash.
   - If `c.id` is not in `old`: create a jj commit with parent = the jj commit
     written for `c`'s parent in this walk, tree from `c.files`, description
     `c.message`, author and committer from `user` (§7.9) and the current
     time, change id `c.id`.
   - Otherwise, if `c`'s parent's *written* commit hash, or `c.files`, or
     `c.message` differs from the stored commit: rewrite it (new commit hash,
     same change id, stored as a successor so jj records predecessors),
     keeping the author and author date, with committer `user` and the
     current time.
   - Otherwise keep the stored commit.
5. **Abandon** every change id in `old` that is not in `new`.
6. **Focus.** The focus must be mutable: if `new.root.id` is the root commit
   or in the immutable set, crash with
   `the focus must be a mutable commit; compose with new`. Otherwise set the
   default workspace's working-copy commit to the commit carrying
   `new.root.id`. (`abandon` and `squash` end with `new` for this reason, so
   they are safe on a commit directly above `main`; navigation onto `main`
   is written `new . goto trunk`.)
7. Commit the operation, then perform the checkout of §7.4.

Labels are not written by persistence at all; they are derived from remote
refs, which only `fetch` and `push` change. The interpreter may run any part
of the walk through jj-lib's rebase machinery provided the stored result
equals what the steps above produce.

### 7.6 Labels and the remote

A label is the name of a bookmark on the remote `origin`, as of the last
`fetch` or `push`. There is one namespace. Labels are read-only in the
language: `fetch` and `push` are the only things that change them.

- **`fetch`** fetches from `origin` over git and imports refs. Afterwards
  each remote bookmark `name` is the label `name` on the commit it points at;
  labels for bookmarks that no longer exist on the remote are removed; commits
  reachable from remote bookmarks become visible. Fetching never moves the
  focus or touches the working directory. It records one operation.
- **`push EXPR`** evaluates `EXPR` (§1.1); a function result is applied to
  the recorded repository. The value must be a list whose elements are records
  of two shapes:
  - `{ id : Id, name : Text }` — set bookmark `name` to the commit `id`,
    creating it if absent;
  - `{ delete : Text }` — delete the bookmark of that name.

  Duplicates are merged; two records with the same `name` and different
  effects are a crash. It is refused (exit 1, nothing pushed) if:
  - a `name` is not a valid git branch name, an `id` is not a visible commit,
    or a delete names a bookmark the remote does not have;
  - any commit that would be sent has an unresolved file or an empty
    description;
  - the bookmark's current target is in the immutable set (§7.5) and the
    record would move it to a commit that does not descend from it, or delete
    it.

  Moving a bookmark whose current target is not immutable to an unrelated
  commit is allowed; that is how a rewritten stack is re-pushed. After a
  successful push the labels reflect the new positions. It records one
  operation.

Only the remote named `origin` is supported in this version; `fetch` and
`push` exit 1 with `j: no remote origin` when it is not configured.
Authentication is git's: the ssh agent for ssh URLs, git credential helpers
for https, as jj-lib's git backend provides them; `j` adds no prompting.
Bringing work up to date is a separate expression, e.g. `rebase trunk`.

### 7.7 Operations, undo, redo, and the lock

Every persisting `j` program, and each of `fetch` and `push`, records exactly
one jj operation, described by the expression or command text. Crashes record
nothing.

**Kinds.** `j` marks each operation it records, in the operation's metadata,
as *normal*, *undo* (naming the operation it undid), or *redo* (naming the
undo it reversed). Operations recorded by other tools are treated as normal,
except that an operation whose description carries jj's own undo or redo
marker is treated accordingly, so mixed use chains correctly where the marker
is present and degrades to "undo the newest operation" where it is not.

**`undo`** finds the operation to undo: starting at the head, while the
current operation is an undo, move to the operation it undid and then to that
operation's parent; while it is a redo, move past the operation it reapplied.
The first normal operation reached is undone by recording a new operation
that restores its parent's view, marked as an undo of it. If none is found,
exit 1 with `j: nothing to undo`.

**`redo`** requires the head to be an undo (possibly reached through redos);
it records an operation restoring the view of the operation that undo
discarded, marked as a redo. Otherwise exit 1 with `j: nothing to redo`.

Both refuse, before doing anything, if the working directory differs from the
focused commit's files: `j: working copy has changes not in @; run \`j id\`
to record them or discard them`. Both check out the restored focus afterwards.
Undoing a `push` restores the recorded labels and leaves the remote untouched.

**`ops`** prints the operation log, newest first, one line each: relative
time, the operation's description (a `j` expression, a command, or another
tool's description), and `undo`/`redo` where applicable; the current
operation is marked. Rendered in the binary like `tree`.

**Lock.** A run that may persist (any expression evaluation, `fetch`, `push`,
`undo`, `redo`) takes an exclusive lock, the file `.jj/j.lock`, for its
duration.
A second `j` exits 2 with `j: another j is running in this repository`.
Display-only runs are not distinguishable in advance, so they take the lock
too; only reserved commands that need no repository (`init`, `clone`) do not.
The lock prevents `j` from ever producing two commits with one change id.
Other tools operating concurrently are outside `j`'s control; if they produce
that state, §7.2 applies.

### 7.8 Creating and connecting repositories

- **`init`** creates a colocated repository (both `.jj` and `.git`) in the
  current directory. If `.git` already exists and `.jj` does not, jj is
  initialised on top of the existing git repository and its history is
  imported (subject to §7.2). Either way a working-copy commit is created as a
  child of the current head (or of the root commit for an empty repository)
  and checked out. It exits 2 if the directory is already inside a jj
  repository, or if `.git` exists but is not a directory (a git worktree or
  submodule). It requires `user` (§7.9).
- **`clone URL [DIR]`** creates `DIR` (exit 2 if it exists and is non-empty),
  clones `URL` into it as a colocated repository, sets `origin` to `URL`,
  fetches, and creates an empty working-copy commit as a child of the
  remote's default bookmark target (or of the root commit if the remote has
  none). It requires `user`.
- **`remote URL`** sets the URL of `origin`, creating the remote if it does not
  exist. It does not fetch.

### 7.9 Identity

Commits are authored and committed as `user.name <user.email>` from
`config.j` (§6.3). `j` reads no other configuration; jj-lib's settings object
is constructed by `j` from `user` and fixed defaults. `init`, `clone`, and
persistence exit 3 if `user` is missing or malformed, since that is a
configuration error.

### 7.10 External diff rendering

`difft p a b` runs difftastic. It is the only builtin that executes another
program.

1. Write the content of `a` and `b` to two temporary files whose names end in
   the last component of `p` (so difftastic's language detection sees the
   real filename), inside a fresh temporary directory.
2. Run `difft OLD NEW` with the process's stdin closed and its environment
   inherited unchanged, except: if `DFT_COLOR` is unset and `j`'s stdout is a
   terminal, set `DFT_COLOR=always`; if `DFT_WIDTH` is unset and `j`'s stdout
   is a terminal, set it to the terminal width.
3. Capture stdout. Delete the temporary directory.
4. Return stdout as `Text`. A non-zero exit status is not an error (difftastic
   uses it to signal "differences found" under some options); a failure to
   execute the program is a crash naming it.

All rendering options are difftastic's own, set through its `DFT_*`
environment variables. `j` adds no options of its own. `diff` remains
available as a dependency-free unified diff; the reference `config.j` uses
`difft` for display, so a user without difftastic edits one line.

Packaging: difftastic is a runtime dependency; on Nix, wrap `j` with `difft`
on its `PATH`.

### 7.11 Tree rendering

`treeWith options r` renders the history as text. It is implemented in the
binary because it is presentation, not semantics. It reads the `Repo` value,
the immutable set (§7.5), `diff` sizes, and (for the margin, ages, and the
sibling order) jj's commit metadata by id.

#### Options

```
{ detail : Int      -- 0, 1, or 2; see below
, margin : Bool     -- age and author column
, elide  : Bool     -- fold uninteresting runs
, icons  : Bool     -- pictographic glyph set
, color  : Text }   -- "auto", "always", "never"
```

Commits with no stored counterpart — minted in this program, as in a dry
run — have no metadata: their margin cells are blank, their size bar is
computed from the value, and they sort last among their siblings. The same
holds for a `Commit` block in display (§5.1).

Missing fields crash. `color = "auto"` means colour iff stdout is a terminal.
If the environment variable `NO_COLOR` is set and non-empty, colour is never
used regardless of `color`. `config.j` fixes the defaults by defining `tree`.

#### Layout

Root at top, one line per commit, plus optional detail lines under the focus.

```
   ⌂ zzzz

   ◆ kpqx ▅  add parser                  main                   3d  mo

```

(That is `detail = 2, margin = true`. With `detail = 1, margin = false`, the
size bars, the margin, and the detail line are absent.)

Columns, left to right:

1. **Gutter**, two characters: `▶` on the focus line, blank otherwise.
2. **Rails**: `│ ├─ └─`, two columns per depth; `╎ n` for an elided run
   (§Elision).
3. **Node glyph**: what kind of commit.
4. **Id**: shortest prefix unique among visible commits, minimum 4.
5. **Size bar** (`detail ≥ 1`, focus and its parent and children only; all
   commits at `detail = 2`): one of `▁ ▂ ▃ ▅ ▇`, lines added plus removed
   against the parent, thresholds 1, 10, 50, 200, 1000. Absent for empty
   commits.
6. **Message**: first line; nothing if empty.
7. **Labels**: right-aligned column, present only if any rendered commit has
   a label; names separated by two spaces.
8. **Margin** (`margin = true`): age and author initials, right-aligned.
   Age is the committer time, rendered `Ns`, `Nm`, `Nh`, `Nd`, `Nw`, `Ny`.
   Initials are the first letters of the author name's words, at most two.
9. **Collapse marker** `⋯ n` after the message of a collapsed subtree's top.

**Detail line** (`detail = 2`, focus only): indented under the focus, the
changed paths with a mark each: `+` added, `~` modified, `−` deleted,
`✖` unresolved. Renames are not detected; they appear as `−` and `+`.

#### Glyphs

| glyph | meaning | `icons = true` |
|---|---|---|
| `◉` | focus | `🌸` |
| `●` | ancestor of the focus | `🌿` |
| `○` | other commit | `🍃` |
| `◆` | in the immutable set (§7.5) | `🪨` |
| `◌` | empty: no change against its parent | `🫙` |
| `⊗` | has unresolved files | `🔥` |
| `⌂` | root | `🌱` |

Precedence when several apply: `⌂`, then `⊗`, then `◌`, then `◆`, then the
position glyphs; position is then carried by colour (and, for the focus, by
`▶`).

#### Elision (`elide = true`)

A commit is *interesting* if it is the focus, an ancestor of the focus, a
child of an ancestor of the focus, labelled, conflicted, a leaf, or has more
than one child. Runs of consecutive uninteresting commits on a single line of
descent are folded into `╎ n`. Subtrees whose top commit is not the focus, an
ancestor of it, or a child of an ancestor are rendered as their top commit
followed by `⋯ n` (omitted when `n = 0`), where `n` counts hidden descendants.
With `elide = false` everything is shown.

#### Colour

Applied only when colour is on. Glyphs always carry the meaning; colour only
adds emphasis, so a colourless rendering loses nothing.

| element | treatment |
|---|---|
| focus line | bold, faint background |
| ancestors of the focus | normal |
| all other lines | dim |
| rails on the path from the top to the focus | cyan |
| other rails, `╎ n`, `⋯ n` | dim |
| id of a conflicted commit | red |
| id of an immutable commit | blue |
| message of an empty commit | dim italic |
| labels | green |
| size bar | one accent colour, brighter with size |
| detail marks `+` `−` `~` `✖` | green, red, yellow, red |
| age | grey scale: brighter when more recent |
| author initials | a hue chosen per author, stable across runs (hash of the name) |

Messages are never coloured except dim (cousins) and dim italic (empty).

## 8. Laws

These hold for the reference `config.j` and should be property-tested against
an in-memory implementation of the builtins (§10). `=` means the results are

## 9. Reference `config.j`

This file is the complete definition of the language's vocabulary. It ships
with the binary and is the version installed to `~/.config/j/config.j`.

```haskell
-- config.j — everything j knows.
--
-- j reads this file on every run. An expression can use a name only if this
-- file declares it (a builtin, implemented by j) or defines it (written here,
-- in the language). Nothing else exists.
--
-- Conventions in this file:
--   Name = …          a shape: a record layout, matched by its field names
--   name : Type       a signature. Alone, it declares a builtin implemented
--                     by j. Before a definition, it documents that definition.
--                     Either way j checks arguments and results against it at
--                     each call, one level deep: kind, list-ness, field names.
--   name = expr       a definition. Functions are lambdas: name = \x -> …
--
-- Edits.  Most definitions are Edits: functions from a Repo to a Repo. On the
-- command line a function result is applied to the current repository; a Repo
-- result is persisted. Anything else is printed. `e2 . e1` runs e1 then e2;
-- `e or id` runs e and leaves things alone if it crashes.
--
-- Four definitions here are read by j itself: `user` (who commits), `tree`
-- (how a Repo is printed), `immutable` (which commits may never be
-- rewritten), and `labelled` (what a %name literal means).

## 10. Testing

The interpreter must be testable without a jj repository. Provide an in-memory
implementation of the domain builtins (`replay`, `unresolved`, `blob`,
`text`, `by`, `extract`, `meta`, `difft` as a stub, and the minting
of `@`) in which a blob is text, a
conflict is a record of the three sides, and `replay` resolves a path exactly
when at most one side changed it or both made the same change. Property-test
the laws of §8 over randomly generated `Repo` values (bounded depth and width,
random labels, random file edits) using the reference `config.j` unmodified.

The builtin `by` must agree, on every generated repo, with this in-language
reference definition, which uses positional moves the public base does not
expose:

```haskell
down = \i repo ->
  let k = nth i repo.children
  in { root = k.root, children = k.children
     , context = { parent = repo.root, left = take i repo.children, right = drop (i + 1) repo.children }
                 :: repo.context }
locs = \l -> l :: (concat (map (\i -> locs (down i l)) (range 0 (length l.children))) or [])
by   = \i repo -> head (filter (\l -> l.root.id == i) (locs (top repo))) or crash "by: no such commit"
```

Golden tests: parse the reference `config.j`; `show` round-trips through the
parser for generated values of every kind except closures; every example in
§11 produces the stated result.

## 11. The development flow, end to end

Each step of ordinary development, and what covers it. Anything not listed
here is out of scope (§12). Nothing here uses the `jj` binary.

**Getting a repository**

```
$EDITOR ~/.config/j/config.j              -- set `user` once
j init                                    -- new repository here, or adopt an existing .git
j clone git@host:org/repo.git             -- or an existing one
j remote git@host:org/repo.git            -- attach a remote to an init'd repo
```

**Looking**

```
j tree                                    -- the history as a tree, focus marked
j treeFull                                -- the same with sizes, ages, authors, changed paths
j status                                  -- id, message, labels, changed paths, conflicts of @
j log                                     -- every commit as a record
j review                                  -- difftastic rendering of @ against its parent
j review . by @kpq                        -- the same for another commit, without moving
j diffs                                   -- the same, one record per path
j here                                    -- @'s id
j kids                                    -- @'s children, as a commit table
j conflicts                               -- every conflicted commit
j 'map (.path) . files'                   -- paths tracked in @
j 'text . contentAt ./README.md . files'
j focus                                   -- the focused commit
j 'meta . (.id) . focus'                  -- its git hash, author, time
```

**Working**

```
j 'describe "fix login"'
j new                                     -- start the next commit
j prev                                    -- to the parent
j next                                    -- to the only child
j new . goto trunk                        -- start on the main line; the focus must be a mutable commit
j by @kpq                                 -- any unique id prefix
j into @kpq                               -- a child, by id
j 'child (\c -> startsWith "fix" c.message)'
j 'split (ext "rs")'                      -- *.rs changes into a new child
j 'contract (under ./docs)'               -- docs/ changes down into the parent
j squash
j abandon
j rebase trunk
j guard clean . rebase trunk or id        -- only if it comes out clean
j pick @kpq
j 'forEach (descendantsOf here) (describe "wip")'
j id                                      -- record the working directory, change nothing else
j tree . squash                           -- dry run: show the result, persist nothing
j tree . validate . squash                -- the same, refusing what persistence would refuse
j squash && j tree                        -- do, then look
```

**Sharing**

```
j 'push (label "feature" here)'           -- name @ on the remote
j push relabel                            -- move the remote's existing names to the rewritten stack
j 'push (unlabel "feature")'             -- delete a name on the remote
j 'push (rename "old" "new")'           -- move a name
j fetch                                   -- refresh the remote's names and commits
j rebase trunk                            -- bring the stack up to date
```

**Conflicts**

A rebase or fetch that conflicts leaves unresolved files in the affected
commits. `j conflicts` lists them; `j by @…` moves there, which checks the
files out with conflict markers; editing the files and running any persisting
expression (`j id` at minimum) records the resolution.

**Mistakes**

```
j ops                                     -- what happened, newest first
j undo                                    -- reverts one j expression
j redo
```

**Own commands**

Any definition added to `config.j` whose value is an `Edit` is a command:

```haskell
pr = \n -> describe n . squash
```

```
j 'pr "fix login"' && j 'push (label "fix-login" here)'
```

## 12. Out of scope for this version

Second parents of merge commits (merges are placed under their first parent
and are read-only); hunk-level `split`; conflict resolution inside the
language (blobs are opaque); workspaces other than the default; remotes other
than `origin`; tags; submodules and LFS; ignore rules beyond `.gitignore`;
changing file modes or symlinks from the language; repairing a repository in
which one change id has two visible commits (refused; §7.2); a `--help` flag
or any flag at all; static typing. None of these are precluded by the design.
